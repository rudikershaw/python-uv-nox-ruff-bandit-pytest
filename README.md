Project template for a simple project setup using uv, nox, ruff, mypy, bandit, audit, and pytest. 

This is my current preferred basic python project setup. For anything you intend to work seriously on consider adding pytest-cov, pytest-benchmark, assertpy, etc. To use, simply fork the project and crack on.

## Prerequisites

### uv

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management, virtual environment management, and task running. To install uv, see the [official installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

The project was initialised with uv 0.11.6. You can verify that you have 0.11 or later using `uv --version`.

While working on the project we recommend you use `uv run` to run any project relevant commands, to maintain a consist python version and environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (including dev dependencies):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
3. Run the full `nox` session.
   ```bash
   uv nox run
   ```

## Development Workflow

This project uses [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) for task running. All development tasks (linting, formatting, testing) are defined as Nox sessions. While you work on this project, we recommend you use `uv run nox` to run any linting or checks that you need. For specific tasks, please review the `noxfile.py` or use `uv run nox -l` in your terminal.
